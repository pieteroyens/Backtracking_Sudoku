# Backtracking_Sudoku
Implements backtracking to solve sudoku puzzles in C#

This was made for the course Computational Intelligence at the University of Utrecht. The course required for code comments and report to be written in dutch, so I apologize for any english readers. 
The report and pseudo code description are in also (unfortunately) in dutch.
How fast the code solves different sudoku board size can be seen in the Results.pdf.
